 MaraDNS changelog
 
+   maradns-3.4.08:
+   This is a legacy release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * Y2038 fixes backported to the 3.4 version of MaraDNS and Deadwood
+      * Windows32 binaries of the 3.4 version of MaraDNS/Deadwood updated
+
+     (2022-11-19)
+
+   maradns-3.5.0028:
+   This is a stable release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * Y2038 issues with MaraDNS for win32 have been addressed.
+      * maradns.exe restored; things tested and look to run after Y2038
+
+     (2022-11-17)
+
+   maradns-3.5.0027:
+   This is a stable release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * HOTFIX: 3.5.0026 introduced a bug where zone files without a SOA
+        record last edited before mid-2020 would have an incorrect
+        serial in the synthetic SOA record.  Fixed.
+      * Y2038 fix for serials in zone files without a SOA edited after
+        the Y2038 cutoff on systems with a 32-bit time_t.
+      * Only update Deadwood.exe in Git when doing the win32 build.
+
+     (2022-11-12)
+
+   maradns-3.5.0026:
+   This is a stable release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * coLunacyDNS updated to 1.0.012 (minor speed up with the SipHash
+        code)
+      * A number of old unused tests and scripts moved over to
+        https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS-attic  This is old stuff
+        which hasn’t beed used for about 15 years.
+      * Fixing minor potential Y2038 issues in MaraDNS and Deadwood code
+        base.
+      * Since localtime() won’t work come 2038 if time_t is 32-bit,
+        I have updated code to not show localtime() derived timestamps
+        if time_t is 32 bits.  I would rather not show any timestamp than
+        show one with a wrong date come 2038, and people with a 64-bit
+        time_t (pretty much any system from the last five years) will
+        see no change.  This only affects MaraDNS’s logging, and only
+        in the rare case of timestamp_type being set in a mararc
+        file.
+      * Deadwood has a feature where it won’t load the cache if the
+        dwood3rc file has been changed more recently than the cache
+        file.  This feature has been disabled on systems with a 32-bit
+        time_t; the workaround is for the user to be sure to delete their
+        cache after they alter their dwood3rc file (or to upgrade to a
+        system with a 64-bit time_t).  This is only in effect if
+        cache_file is set and used.
+      * Synthetic serial numbers now have their highest possible value be
+        in the year 2841 or 4294; serials are now, as per RFC1035, unsigned
+        32-bit numbers.  If you’re in the 2800s and reading this, thank
+        you for using my code so many years later, and synthetic SOA
+        serials will wrap around, so be sure your secondaries only
+        require the serial to change and that it doesn’t have to
+        increment.  Another option for 29th century MaraDNS users
+        is to have SOA records in your zone files and set the serial
+        by hand.
