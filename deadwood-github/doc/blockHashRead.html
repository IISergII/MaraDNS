<H1>NAME</H1>
blockHashRead - Read a block hash file

<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
blockHashRead is a stand alone command line tool which converts
a <i>block hash file</i> in to a list of hostnames.  This way, a
binary block hash file can be converted in to an ASCII list of host
names, edited, and then converted back in to a binary block hash
file with the <b>blockHashMake</b> utility.

<p>

A block hash file uses a special binary format for storing a list of
blocked host names.

<H1>USAGE</H1>

blockHashRead is invoked as follows:

<pre>
blockHashRead --dump bigBlock.bin
</pre>

Replace "bigBlock.bin" with the filename for the block hash file.

<p>

Doing this will output, on standard output, a list of host names
in the block hash file.  Each line will contain a single host name.
When compiled for *NIX, the output will use *NIX line feeds; the 
Windows port of blockHashRead uses DOS line feeds.

<p>

blockHashRead can be invoked with a single "--help" or "--version"
command line argument (e.g. "blockHashRead --version") which will
output the version number of blockHashRead and provide basic usage
information.

<H1>HOST LIST FORMAT</H1>

After being invoked, blockHashRead writes a list of host names to
the standard output.  The format is a single host name per line of input,
such as the following:

<pre>
porn.example.com
naughty.foo
evil.host.invalid
</pre>

Each line is a host name.  

<p>

blockHashRead has no support for Punycode.  Please use another program
to convert international domain names with non-ASCII characters in to their
non-punycode representation if seeing correct international domain names
is desired.

<H1>LIMITATIONS</H1>

The block hash format that blockHashRead looks at is a 32-bit format, and the
resulting block hash file should be under 2,147,483,648 bytes in size.
This is a limitation of around 30 million host names.
