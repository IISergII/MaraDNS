 MaraDNS changelog
 
+   maradns-3.4.07: 
+   This is a legacy release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * Deadwood updated to 3.4.07
+        - doc/Deadwood.txt was blank file.  Fixed.
+        - Deadwood’s document building process now uses the 3.5 Lua
+          instead of the older 3.4 Perl scripts.
+        - Have doc/Makefile be compatible with maramake
+      * Since MaraDNS 3.5 now uses maramake as the official make platform,
+        update the 3.4 branch to work with the 3.5 toolchain, so I do not
+        have to maintain two toolchains.
+      * MaraDNS 3.4 still uses the Perl scripts and Lynx/Links to build
+        documents; only Deadwood’s document processing has been updated
+        (but this will probably change in a future 3.4 release, again so
+        I only have to maintain one toolchain)
+
+     (2022-11-10)
+
+   maradns-3.5.0025:
+   This is a stable release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * The ej2man, ej2txt, and ej2html tools have been rewritten in
+        Lua 5.1
+      * The old ej tools are now at https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS-attic/
+      * bind2csv2.py now at https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS-attic/
+      * All documents now render with the Lua EJ tools
+      * Makefiles are now POSIX compliant, as long as the make
+        implementation allows / in make targets
+      * Tweak Deadwood Makefile to not regenerate DwRandPrime.h
+
+     (2022-10-31)
+
+   maradns-3.5.0024:
+   This is a stable release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * Minor security fix for Deadwood to ensure that no more than 83
+        queries are made to solve a given request when run as a fully
+        recursive server.  This only affects setups where root_servers
+        is set in the Deadwood dwood3rc configuration file.
+      * Some Deadwood tests have been made more robust so they are much
+        less likely to randomly fail.
+      * Update Alpine 3.14 Dockerfile to have lua5.1-bit32 and patch.
+        This Docker image can test both the legacy 3.4 and the current
+	3.5 branches of MaraDNS.
+      * Deadwood no longer changes its random prime for the hash 
+        compressor every time it is compiled, unless the new 
+	Makefile.randomprime file is used.
+      * The ej tools to make the MaraDNS documentation are now unified.
+        ej is a format I came up with in early 2002 to give MaraDNS
+	a unified documentation format.
+      * Move coLunacyDNS to the top-level directory instead of hiding
+        it in deadwood-${VERSION}/tools/  lunacy is now in coLunacyDNS/
+	instead of deadwood-${VERSION}
+      * Begin work on making Lua versions of the ej tools, to remove
+        the final Perl dependency MaraDNS currently has.  Right now 
+	we have a Lua script to convert .ej files in to .html files.
+	We are still using the Perl tools to make documents until 
+	this work is done and tested.
+      * time-test.c tool added to make sure we will be OK after Y2038
+        on systems with a 32-bit time_t.  Yes, MaraDNS is Y2038
+        compliant on such systems as long as the underlying timestamp
+        is being updated.
+      * Update the version of lunacy (Lua 5.1 fork) included with 
+        MaraDNS to fix a theoretical issue with its RadioGatun[32] 
+	implementation, and to give lunacy lunacy.today() support
+	(so that we can use the lunacy included with MaraDNS to
+	build the MaraDNS documents)
+     
+     (2022-10-24)
