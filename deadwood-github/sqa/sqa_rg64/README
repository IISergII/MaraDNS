These are all of the official test vectors for RadioGatun[64].  The vectors 
have had their formatting changed to make running the test more convenient:

fgrep \( RG64-testvectors  | awk '{print $NF}' | grep -v S | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' 

(The pedantically correct form of "fgrep" may be "grep -F", but fgrep
 has been around for well over 25 years)

I have also added a UTF-8 test vector, and run the test against both
clang and gcc at various levels of optimization (mainly because there
was a bug in the rg32 code which only manifests itself in clang, but
only at -O2 and -O3).
