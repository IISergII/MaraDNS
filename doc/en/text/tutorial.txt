MaraDNS tutorial    

===MaraDNS tutorials and usage guides===

MaraDNS includes a number of tutorials and usage guides which cover 
everything from teaching DNS basics for someone who has never 
administered a DNS server before to usage guides on exotic things such 
as using private CNAME records that point to public DNS entries. 

For people who have never used DNS before, the DNS introduction 
guide is a good place to start. For people who have some experience 
with DNS servers, the quick start guide is a good place to start.
