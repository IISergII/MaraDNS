 MaraDNS changelog
 
+   maradns-3.4.09:
+   This is a legacy release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * MaraDNS and Deadwood no longer allow ANY queries as per RFC8482
+
+     (2022-11-25)
+
+   maradns-3.5.0029:
+   This is a stable release of MaraDNS:
+
+      * Deadwood now implements RFC8482: All ANY and HINFO queries now
+        return a RFC8482 reply by default.  The older behavior can be
+        restored by editing Deadwood’s configuration file.
+      * Documentation updates: Updated security bug reporting policy,
+        Document maradns.exe for Windows is unsupported, document
+        new rfc8482 behavior, note changes made for MaraDNS 3.4.08,
+        etc.
+      * Windows builds of Deadwood now use dates for version numbers.
+        This way, I don’t need to update the .exe binary if a release
+        without Deadwood source changes is made.
